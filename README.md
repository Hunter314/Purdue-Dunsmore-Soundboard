# Purdue University Professor Buster Dunsmore Soundboard

This is a simple, humorous, soundboard, made in Java, utilizing Swing Components, that plays a variety of sounds that Professor Buster Dunsmore (who is a CS Professor at Purdue University), has made over the course of this semester. Have fun! And if you have any further sounds you'd want me to add to the soundboard, make a fork of the project, add the code in your own fork, and I'll be more than happy to merge it into the main code!
